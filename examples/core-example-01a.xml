    NAME          : Comic Book Schema (Core) - Example #01A
    DESCRIPTION   : Basic XML description of Daredevil #67 using only required core elements.
    SUMMARY       : The core schema only requires the usage of 6 elements to identify a work. These required elements include 
                    the publisher name, country, series title, series year, issue number, and language. Volume number is optional.
                    Note that no format, variance, condition, etc. has been specified. By adding additional properties to a
                    description we can begin to identify a specific example, or manifestation, of Daredevil #67, such as 
                    the digital edition or a reprinted copy.
