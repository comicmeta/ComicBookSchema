    NAME          : Comic Book Schema (Core) - Example #02A
    DESCRIPTION   : Detailed XML record for a specific manifestation of Daredevil #67
    SUMMARY       : The creative work that represents Daredevil #67, i.e. the story, artwork, etc. can be embodied in multiple formats. 
                    It can be downloaded as a digital comic, reprinted in a collection of similar works, or reproduced long after the 
                    original publication date. In order to describe a specific manifestation, or example, of Daredevil #67 we need to 
                    add additional descriptive elements to our record. By further detailing which version of Daredevil #67 we are 
                    describing, we move closer to identifying a specific, tangible copy of Daredevil #67.
                    
                    Note in the example below we are using qualified XML elements, prefixed with "cbo", and we have repeated the
                    <format> element in order specify that this record describes a color comic book. If we were to change this value
                    to digital comic, we would be describing a different manifestation of Daredevil #67.
